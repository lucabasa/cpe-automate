    "The Center for Policing Equity has the mission of helping law enforcement professionals to better protect and serve the citizens of their cities. The path that was chosen is to use data to find and document situations where the disparity in treatment can compromise the mission of *protect and serve*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources available to accomplish such mission are:\n",
    "* census data\n",
    "* policing data about use of force or other police-related actions\n",
    "* maps\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to effectively combine these sources in order to make easy for a field expert to discover and document critical situations. The primary objective is to combine police data with census data and, as we will see, the shapefiles are a way of achieving this. In this notebook, I will present some descriptive statistics about census data and police data in order to display how I think the automation process should be. It is important to remember that any conclusion that didn't pass through several levels of skepticism has to be considered incorrect. For example, knowing that the majority of arrests involves a specific race means nothing without knowing how the underlying population is composed. Even then, the available data can be enough to prove that there is a significant difference from one segment of the population to the other but they are not telling us yet the reason behind this difference. Therefore, I strongly invite the reader to keep a skeptic eye towards what follows and please let me know if there is something methodologically wrong or other silly mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick look at the available data reveals that, for how much effort it was spent to standardize the input of such analysis, it is not obvious to immediately get what data is available and what isn't. The United States of America is a place with wildly diverse situations and the data describing different places represent this diversity not only in the content, but also in the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, given a department and a suitable amount of time, it is not difficult to generate a report with the available data. However, the work has to be repeated almost from scratch once that we want to analyze the next department. On the other hand, investing time and resources in maintaining a healthy database can be a frustrating job because the data are coming from many different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the solution proposed here aims to make easier to spot a problem in the data (thus before spending precious hours starting an analysis that can not be finished), have a quick overview of the relevant available information, and thus pave the way to combine and better explore a given department. It would foolish of me thinking that the proposed exploration is in any way satisfactory for an expert, simply because I do not have that expertise in this field. Here I want to propose a process that can facilitate the work of an expert, not to replace it. For this reason, every function was written with the intent of being customizable (either due to other preferences, different needs, or changes in the data). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check the quality of the data.\n",
    "* Import every piece of information available for a department\n",
    "* Get an overview of the census data\n",
    "* Get an overview of the police data\n",
    "* A simple way of combining these two sources of data\n",
    "* A case study to show how to combine census and police data and example analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 cities used here are **Dallas** and **Indianapolis**. The former used just to introduce the various functions, the latter will also be subject of an analysis.\n",

    "This kernel has great margins of improvements and customization. The cases here presented (Dallas for the exposition of the base functions and Indianapolis for the case study) were chosen fairly randomly and I am particularly happy about being able to change an index on the top of the page and get similar results without too much work. All that being said, choices were made along the way and were biased by my curiosity, interest, and ability of execution. Therefore I see this as a first step and I really hope it will inspire someone to make it better or to perform a more accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I take away from this kernel is the following. Summary statistics and aggregations are necessary to peek into the message contained in very large datasets. However, it has to be kept in mind that the story they tell is always an approximation of a complex situation. **Different levels of granularity can tell different stories**. Pretty much in the same way people say *Africa is poor* or *Europe is rich*, completely ignoring that Africa is a very big place with very different stories to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say that because we often observe that the percentages of crimes by race are not proportional to the underlying population and any statistical test of goodness of fit will tell that no, that sample is not randomly extracted from the population. When this happens, the counter-argument is sometimes related to different crime rates and socioeconomic indicators, etc. All of this is true but they are all a simplification of a very complex argument, ignoring relations of cause and effect while focusing on correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, the response of trained officials should be guaranteed by a democratic State and, if we observe that it is not uniform if the color of the skin of a suspect is different, then we have a problem. Here, we have seen that the police was behaving fairly uniformly in any use of force, except for the lethal use of force. This is my definition of injustice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the sake of completeness, even this result is partial. Not only a table does not contain the nuances of a situation but also does not contain all the counterfactuals. In other words, we don't know from this data how many times an officer could have used lethal force but didn't as well as we don't know what would have happened if the lethal force was not used. In my vision, a complete analysis would require that as well, or it will risk being biased in searching for a bias.\n",
